This project implements Branch and Bound Skyline algorithm 
using Hashing algorithms as data partitioning structures.

Branch and Bound Skyline is based on the following paper:
Dimitris Papadias, Yufei Tao, Greg Fu, and Bernhard Seeger. 2005. Progressive skyline computation in database systems. <em>ACM Trans. Database Syst.</em> 30, 1 (March 2005), 41-82. DOI=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1061318.1061320

All Hashing algorithms are translated from the matlab implementation from 
the following repository:
