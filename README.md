# hash_skyline
This project implements Branch and Bound Skyline.
To efficient calculate the skyline in high dimensionality datasets
the R-Tree has been replaced with hashing algorithms. 
Four state-of-the-art hashing algorithms are used here instead of R-Tree.

In the following paper there are details regarding performance
and experimentation of different skyline calculation algorithms.
Results of this study shows that hashing algorithms are more efficient 
in high dimensional space.
